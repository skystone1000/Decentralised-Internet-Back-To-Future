Diving deep into Decentralized Internet and writing the survey report was so much fun. The motivation for this was the TV series Silicon Valley. Looking at how much power these big tech companies own ( like FANGs ) due to the data they have. Also, the leaks of data have become a major issue recently, questioning the privacy of everyone. Centralized data storage has increased security issues and also the chances of being attacked. Studying such issues made me think 
 "Why is the Internet centralized and was it like that always ???"
"Are there some Decentralized Systems available??? "

Looking at some implementations like TOR, Matrix, Crypto-currencies, etc made me realize that Decentralization is the future.
